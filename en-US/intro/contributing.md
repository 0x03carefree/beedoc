# Contributing to Beego

## Introduction
Beego is a free and open source software, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and progress. Beego's source code is hosted on github, which provides a very easy way to fork the project and merge your contributions.


## Pull Requests
The process of pull requests for new features and bug fixes are not the same. Before you submit a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with `[Proposal]` in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as the implementation approach. Proposals will be reviewed and discussed, and can be adopted or potentially rejected. When a proposal is adopted, then create an implementation of the new features in the form of a pull request. If the guidelines are not followed, the pull request will be rejected immediately.

Pull requests for bug fixes don't need to create an issue first. If you have a solution to a bug, please describe your solution in detail in your pull request.

You can also contribute to improve the documentation at [beedoc](https://github.com/beego/beedoc).

Submit new features

If you want to see a new feature in Beego, you can create an issue with `[Request]` in the title. Then the  request will be reviewed by the core contributors.

Now Beego adopts gitflow way of development, so the ongoing development happens in the `develop` branch. Therefore please submit all of your pull requests to the `develop` branch.
